    <h2>Christophe Marcellus</h2>
    <p> I’m Christophe Marcellus, a dedicated student and aspiring developer with a deep interest in AI, mobile app development, and web development. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on various projects that combine creativity with technology, from building AI-powered nutrition apps like FitPal to developing automation scripts for social media. My passion for web development stems from the ability to create dynamic, user-friendly experiences that reach a wide audience. I love the challenge of making web applications both functional and visually appealing, and I’m constantly learning new technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to enhance my skills.  </p>
