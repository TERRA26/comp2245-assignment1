    <h2>Christophe Marcellus</h2>
    <p>I’m Christophe Marcellus, a dedicated student and aspiring developer with a deep interest in AI and mobile app development. Throughout my journey, I’ve worked on various projects that combine creativity with technology, from building AI-powered nutrition apps like FitPal to developing automation scripts for social media. I’m passionate about fitness and nutrition, and I enjoy finding ways to integrate these interests into my work. With experience in Python, React Native, and API integration, I’m constantly exploring new tools and techniques to push my skills further. As I continue my studies, I’m excited to keep learning and developing innovative solutions that can make a real impact. </p>
